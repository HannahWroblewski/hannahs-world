I greatly enjoy technology and consider myself to be quite tech-savvy. Last December, I completed a 6-month long bootcamp through the University of North Florida hosted by Full Stack Academy. I shortly began working for FSA as a mentor to students taking the same course that I did, as well as assisting the Lead Instructor in their lectures. I greatly enjoy new challenges and am eager to keep building my skills!',
